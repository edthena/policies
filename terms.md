__1.3 Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.__ R3 Collaboratives
reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify this Agreement at any time
by posting a notice on the Site, or in the App, or by sending User a notice
via email or postal mail. We will also update the ‘last updated’ date at
the bottom of this page. User shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming
familiar with any such modifications. Use of the Service by User following such
notification constitutes User's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as modified.

__1.4 User Accounts.__ Your account on the Service (your “__User
Account__”) gives you access to the services and functionality that we
may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We
may maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of Users.
If you open a User Account on behalf of a school, educational institution,
organization, or other entity, then (i) “you” includes you and that entity,
and (ii) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of
the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that
you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By connecting to the
Service with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use
your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store
your log-in credentials for that service.

You may never use another User’s User Account without permission. When
creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete information,
and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible
for the activity that occurs on your User Account, and you must keep your
User Account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords
with your User Account. You must notify R3 Collaboratives immediately of any
breach of security or unauthorized use of your User Account. R3 Collaboratives
will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your User
Account. R3 Collaboratives reserves the right, in its discretion, to cancel or

otherwise inappropriate or objectionable; (iii) post advertisements or
solicitations of business; (iv) impersonate another person, including by using
another User’s account; (v) submit material that is copyrighted, protected

consent and authority to provide Student Data, to R3 Collaboratives, or to
authorize R3 Collaboratives to collect Student Data through the Service. To
the extent that R3 Collaboratives collects Student Data, R3 Collaboratives and
the Educational Institution, each agree to uphold their responsibilities under
laws governing Personal Information and Student Data, including in the U.S. the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“__FERPA__”), the Protection
of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), and the Children’s Online Privacy and
Protection Act (“__COPPA__”) and State laws, as applicable.

__14.5. Personal Information of Non-Users, Which Could Include K12 Students.__
Through the course of providing our Services, it is possible that our Users
submit User Submissions that contain personal information of individuals
that are not Users of this Service and who are not covered under Agreements
with R3 Collaboratives. For example, if a User who is a student-teacher in
a University program records video of her work in a classroom at a local
K12 school, the video may contain images of children, teachers, or other
individuals who are not covered by the Agreement between R3 Collaboratives
and the student-teacher’s University. To the extent that you provide
personal information of non-users in User Submissions, including the personal
information of K12 students, you represent and warrant that you comply with all
the provisions of Section 3 User Submissions, above, and have all necessary
rights to provide that information to R3 Collaboratives. We rely on each User
to ensure that appropriate disclosures and consents are obtained, if necessary,
to provide content contained in User Submissions to R3 Collaboratives.

The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that
online service providers obtain parental consent before collecting personal
information from children under 13. R3 Collaboratives does not intentionally
collect personal information from a child under 13. If you provide in User
Content information collected from a student under 13, you represent and
warrant that you are the student’s school or teacher and have received
consent from parents, or have the authority to provide consent on behalf of
parents, for us to collect information from the students before providing User
Content of a child under 13 to our Service. We recommend that all schools and
teachers provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding
their use of service providers such as R3 Collaboratives and that they provide
a copy of our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.

__14.6 User-Requested Third-Party Access.__ R3 Collaboratives may provide users
the ability to use and access third-party services through the Service, and to
share data, including Student Data if applicable, with third-parties through
the Service. If explicitly instructed by you, by the Educational Institution or
by another User authorized to provide such consent, you agree to allow us to
provide access to data, including Student Data, to third parties through the
Service. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for the data practices of
third parties with whom you or your authorized Users elect to share Student
Data, and that, as between us, you are solely responsible for the consequences
of providing or transmitting data, including Student Data, to such third
parties through the Service.

__14.7 Data Retention and Deletion Requests.__ You may request that we
delete your personal information in our possession at any time as set forth
in our Privacy Policy. If your account is utilizing a license provided by
an Educational Institution or enterprise, the licensee may be required to
authorize the deletion request. To contact us about deleting or de-identifying
your account information, provide a written request to <support@edthena.com>,
and we we shall respond to the request within thirty (30) days. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, we may not be able to delete all information contained on the
Service, for example, if such information is part of another User’s User
Submissions or content.

__14.8 Data Localization.__ You acknowledge and agree that R3 Collaboratives
will store and process Personal Information in various data centers around the
world, including in the U.S., and that your Personal Information may not be
stored or processed only within the country in which it was collected unless
and except to the extent required by Law. If you are an Educational Institution
or teacher, you warrant and agree that you have obtained all necessary consents
for R3 Collaboratives to process such Personal Information in the U.S. and
elsewhere in the world.

__14.9 Security, Access and Support; Data Breach Notification.__ We have
implemented commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical
safeguards designed to secure Personal Information, including Student
Data, from unauthorized access, disclosure and use. In the event we have a
reasonable, good faith belief that an unauthorized party has gained access
to or been disclosed Student Data that we have collected or received through
the Service, we will promptly notify the Educational Institution. If Personal
Information, including Student Data, is acquired by an unauthorized party and
such incident triggers any third-party notice requirements under applicable
privacy laws, the Educational Institution shall be responsible for the
timing, content and method of notice and for compliance with such laws for
Users associated with the Educational Institution. R3 Collaboratives shall be
responsible for the timing, content, cost and method of notice and compliance
with such laws as they relate to Users that are not associated with an
Educational Institution.

We will not be liable if for any reason the Service (or any part of it)
is unavailable at any time or for any period. Additionally, access to the
Service may be suspended temporarily and without notice in the case of system
failure, maintenance or repair or for reasons beyond our control. Additionally,
access to the internet, if employed, is your sole responsibility and the
responsibility of the Internet provider(s) you select. R3 Collaboratives does
not accept any responsibility for failure of the Service due to Internet
facilities

## 15. MEMBER DISPUTES

User is solely responsible for your interactions with other Service users. R3
Collaboratives reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes
between User and other Service users. If User has a dispute with one or more
users of the Service, User shall and hereby does release R3 Collaboratives (and
its officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees)
from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind
and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with
such disputes. If User is a California resident, User waives California Civil
Code §1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which
the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his
settlement with the debtor."

## 16. COPYRIGHT

All content included on the Site and/or App, such as text, graphics, logos,
button icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, data compilations, and
software, is the property of R3 Collaboratives or its content suppliers and is
protected by United States and international copyright laws. The compilation of
all content on the Site is the exclusive property of R3 Collaboratives and is
protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. All software used on (or
provided through) the Site is the property of R3 Collaboratives or its software
suppliers and is protected by United States and international copyright laws.

## 17. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS

When User visits the Site or App or sends e-mails to R3 Collaboratives, User is
communicating with R3 Collaboratives electronically. User hereby consents to
receive communications from R3 Collaboratives electronically. R3 Collaboratives
will communicate with User by e-mail or by posting notices on the Site. User
agrees that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications
that R3 Collaboratives provides to User electronically satisfy any legal
requirements that such communications be in writing.

## 18. MISCELLANEOUS

__18.1 Waiver.__ The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any
right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights
hereunder.

__18.2 Force Majeure.__ R3 Collaboratives shall not be liable for any failure
to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause
beyond R3 Collaboratives' reasonable control, including, without limitation,
mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including
"line-noise" interference).

__18.3 Severability.__ If any provision of this Agreement is found to be
unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the
minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full
force and effect and enforceable.

__18.4 Assignability.__ This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or
sublicensable by User except with R3 Collaboratives' prior written consent. R3
Collaboratives may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights
and obligations without consent.

__18.5 Governing Law.__ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the state of California, as if made within
California between two residents thereof, and the parties submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts located in
the City and County of San Francisco, California. The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
is expressly excluded. You agree that the City and County of San Francisco,
California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for
trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is
found to be unenforceable

__18.6 Arbitration.__ Read this section carefully because it requires the
parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can
seek relief from R3 Collaboratives. For any dispute with R3 Collaboratives,
you agree to first contact us at <support@edthena.com> and attempt to resolve
the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that R3 Collaboratives
has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days,
we each agree that any disputes arising with respect to this Agreement shall
be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the
Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. ("__JAMS__"). The arbitrator
shall be selected by joint agreement of the parties. In the event the parties
cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating
party providing the other party with written notice that it plans to seek
arbitration, the parties shall each select an arbitrator affiliated with JAMS,
which arbitrators shall jointly select a third such arbitrator to resolve the
dispute. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will
be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees
in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall
include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs
for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service
for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the
initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee
waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your
costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable
costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims
court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but
this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute
resolution process. The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and
binding on the parties and enforceable in any court. The arbitration proceeding
shall take place in San Francisco, California, using the English language.

__18.7 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.__ With respect to all persons and
entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Service for
personal, commercial or other purposes, all claims must be brought in the
parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or
other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and,
unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
person’s Claims. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and R3
Collaboratives are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate
in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other
representative proceeding of any kind.

__18.8 Entire Agreement.__ Both parties agree that this Agreement is the
complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and
supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications
and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and
that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as
otherwise provided herein.

__18.9 Independent Contractor.__ No agency, partnership, joint venture, or
employment is created as a result of this Agreement and User does not have any
authority of any kind to bind R3 Collaboratives in any respect whatsoever.

## 19. DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT NOTICE

R3 Collaboratives' Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed
Infringement ("__Designated Agent__") is listed at the end of this policy.

It is R3 Collaboratives' policy to (1) block access to or remove content
that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been
illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content
providers, members or users; and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat
offenders.

### A. Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:

If User believes that content residing on or accessible through the R3
Collaboratives Service infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright
infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent
listed below:

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf
of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;

2. Identification of works or materials being infringed;

3. Identification of the content that is claimed to be infringing including
information regarding the location of the content that the copyright owner
seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that R3 Collaboratives is
capable of finding and verifying its existence;

4. Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number
and, if available, e-mail address;

5. A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the content is
not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

of the copyright owner.

### B. Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent:

It is R3 Collaboratives' policy:

1. to remove or disable access to the infringing content;

2. to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or
disabled access to the content;

3. that repeat offenders will have the infringing content removed from the
system; and

4. to terminate such content provider's, member's or user's access to the
service.

### C. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:

If the content provider, member or user believes that the content that was
removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the
content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use
such content from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent or pursuant
to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice
containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

1. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;

2. Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has
been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was
removed or disabled;

3. A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith
belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a
misidentification of the content; and

4. Content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number,
and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity
consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in
which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if the
content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United
States, for any judicial district in which R3 Collaboratives is located, and
that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who
provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, R3 Collaboratives may
send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing
that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in
10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be
replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after
receipt of the counter-notice, at R3 Collaboratives' discretion.
