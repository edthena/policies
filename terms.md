## 13. EXPORT AND TRADE CONTROLS

Our Service is controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. R3
Collaboratives makes no representations that our Service is appropriate or
available for use in other locations. Those who access or use our Service from
other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for
compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations,
including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use our
Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or
are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States
government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on our
Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located
in the United States.

## 14. PRIVACY; PERSONAL INFORMATION AND STUDENT DATA

**14.1 Privacy Policy.** You understand that by using our Service you consent to
the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information
and aggregate and/or anonymized data as set forth in R3 Collaboratives' current
privacy policy, which is available at https://www.edthena.com/privacy (the
"**Privacy Policy**") and is incorporated herein by this reference.

**14.2 Student Data.** To the extent that our Service is used by a College,
University, local education agency, teacher, or other educational institution
("**Educational Institution**") (a) and its students as part of school
curriculum (e.g., a teacher training program in a University, or (b) by teachers
as part of a teachers improvement program, the Personal Information we collect
through our Service may include personal information from "educational records"
as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("**FERPA**"), 20
U.S.C. § 1232(g) ("**Student Data**").

**14.3 Confidentiality.** R3 Collaboratives agrees to treat Student Data as
confidential and not to share it with third parties other than as described in
these Terms, and in our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md).

**14.4 Student Data Access.** To the extent that we collect Student Data through
the provision of our Service, we may access, collect and process Student Data as
a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to FERPA 34
CFR Part 99.31(a)(1). You agree that when R3 Collaboratives is acting as a
School Official, as between the parties, the Educational Institution or
authorized User of that Educational Institution owns and controls all Student
Data.

**14.5 Personal Information and Student Data Consents and Authority.** To the
extent applicable, you represent and warrant that you have the requisite consent
and authority to provide Student Data, to R3 Collaboratives, or to authorize R3
Collaboratives to collect Student Data through our Service. To the extent that
R3 Collaboratives collects Student Data, R3 Collaboratives and the Educational
Institution, each agree to uphold their responsibilities under laws governing
Personal Information and Student Data, including in the U.S. the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("**FERPA**"), the Protection of Pupil Rights
Amendment (PPRA), and the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act
("**COPPA**") and State laws, as applicable.

**14.6. Personal Information of Non-Users, Which Could Include K12 Students.**
Through the course of providing our Services, it is possible that our Users
submit User Content that contain personal information of individuals that are
not Users of this Service and who are not covered under Agreements with R3
Collaboratives. For example, if a User who is a student-teacher in a University
program records video of her work in a classroom at a local K12 school, the
video may contain images of children, teachers, or other individuals who are not
covered by the Agreement between R3 Collaboratives and the student-teacher's
University. To the extent that you provide personal information of non-users in
User Content, including the personal information of K12 students, you represent
and warrant that you comply with all the provisions of Section 3 User Content,
above, and have all necessary rights to provide that information to R3
Collaboratives. We rely on each User to ensure that appropriate disclosures and
consents are obtained, if necessary, to provide content contained in User
Content to R3 Collaboratives.

The Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act ("**COPPA**") requires that
online service providers obtain parental consent before collecting personal
information from children under 13. R3 Collaboratives does not intentionally
collect personal information from a child under 13. If you provide in User
Content information collected from a student under 13, you represent and warrant
that you are the student's school or teacher and have received consent from
parents, or have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents, for us
to collect information from the students before providing User Content of a
child under 13 to our Service. We recommend that all schools and teachers
provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of
service providers such as R3 Collaboratives and that they provide a copy of our
Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.

**14.7 User-Requested Third-Party Access.** R3 Collaboratives may provide users
the ability to use and access third-party services through our Service, and to
share data, including Student Data if applicable, with third-parties through our
Service. If explicitly instructed by you, by the Educational Institution or by
another User authorized to provide such consent, you agree to allow us to
provide access to data, including Student Data, to third parties through our
Service. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for the data practices of
third parties with whom you or your authorized Users elect to share Student
Data, and that, as between us, you are solely responsible for the consequences
of providing or transmitting data, including Student Data, to such third parties
through our Service.

**14.8 Data Retention and Deletion Requests.** You may request that we delete
your personal information in our possession at any time as set forth in our
Privacy Policy. If your account is utilizing a license provided by an
Educational Institution or enterprise, the licensee may be required to authorize
the deletion request. To contact us about deleting or de-identifying your
account information, provide a written request to support@edthena.com, and we
shall respond to the request within thirty (30) days. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, we may not be able to delete all information contained on our
Service, for example, if such information is part of another User's User
Content.

**14.9 Data Localization.** You acknowledge and agree that R3 Collaboratives
will store and process Personal Information in various data centers around the
world, including in the U.S., and that your Personal Information may not be
stored or processed only within the country in which it was collected unless and
except to the extent required by Law. If you are an Educational Institution or
teacher, you warrant and agree that you have obtained all necessary consents for
R3 Collaboratives to process such Personal Information in the U.S. and elsewhere
in the world.

**14.10 Security, Access and Support; Data Breach Notification.** We have
implemented commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical
safeguards designed to secure Personal Information, including Student Data, from
unauthorized access, disclosure and use. In the event we have a reasonable, good
faith belief that an unauthorized party has gained access to or been disclosed
Student Data that we have collected or received through our Service, we will
promptly notify the Educational Institution. If Personal Information, including
Student Data, is acquired by an unauthorized party and such incident triggers
any third-party notice requirements under applicable privacy laws, the
Educational Institution shall be responsible for the timing, content and method
of notice and for compliance with such laws for Users associated with the
Educational Institution. R3 Collaboratives shall be responsible for the timing,
content, cost and method of notice and compliance with such laws as they relate
to Users that are not associated with an Educational Institution.

We will not be liable if for any reason our Service (or any part of it) is
unavailable at any time or for any period. Additionally, access to our Service
may be suspended temporarily and without notice in the case of system failure,
maintenance or repair or for reasons beyond our control. Additionally, access to
the internet, if employed, is your sole responsibility and the responsibility of
the Internet provider(s) you select. R3 Collaboratives does not accept any
responsibility for failure of our Service due to Internet facilities.

## 15. MEMBER DISPUTES

User is solely responsible for your interactions with other Service users. R3
Collaboratives reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes
between User and other Service users. If User has a dispute with one or more
users of our Service, User shall and hereby does release R3 Collaboratives (and
its officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees)
from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and
nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such
disputes. If User is a California resident, User waives California Civil Code
§1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the
creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing
the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement
with the debtor."

## 16. GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION, AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER

**16.1 Governing Law.** You agree that: (i) we will be deemed solely based in
the State of California; and (ii) our Service will be deemed a passive one that
does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general,
in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms will be governed by the
internal substantive laws of California, without respect to its conflict of laws
principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction
involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with
respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16)
("**FAA**") governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration
Agreement in Section 16.2 and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent
permitted by law. If the FAA is determined to not apply to any issue that arises
from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved
under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction
of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco, California for any
actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable
relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks,
trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as
set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief
required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Francisco, California
is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for
trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is
found to be unenforceable.

**16.2 Arbitration.** **READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE
PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK
RELIEF FROM US.** This section 16.2 (the "**Arbitration Agreement**") applies to
and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises
out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) these Terms, including the
formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation,
validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of our Service,
including receipt of any advertising, marketing, or other communications from
us; (c) any transactions through, by, or using our Service; or (d) any other
aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as
a user or consumer ("**Claim**" or collectively, "**Claims**"). The Arbitration
Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were
asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.

If you are a new User, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement
within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at
support@edthena.com with your first and last name and stating your intent to
opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement
does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including
the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be
brought.

For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at support@edthena.com and attempt
to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have
not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve
any Claim through binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited
Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the "**Rules**"), except as
provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com, where the Rules are
available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration
Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement shall control. The arbitration will be
conducted in the U.S. county where you live or San Francisco, California, unless
you and we agree otherwise. If you are using our Service for commercial
purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing,
administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award
rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable
attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are
an individual using our Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may
require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for
and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the
arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's
fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you
may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging
in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in
the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by
the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we
agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency,
shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the
interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration
Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration
Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also be responsible for
determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to
whether these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or
illusory or any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches,
unconscionability, or estoppel.

NOTHING IN THIS SECTION WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE
OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR
THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY,
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM
ASSERTING CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS
THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS,
NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.

If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful,
in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or
in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful
provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions
of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties'
ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis
pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful,
in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive
relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that
relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court
of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration
under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the
parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public
injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims
in arbitration.

**16.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.** WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND
ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED OUR SERVICE FOR
PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE
PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR
OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND,
UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE
PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO
AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON
INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. YOU AND WE
AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT
TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION,
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

## 17. MISCELLANEOUS

discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time, and so you should

we will update the 'last modified' date at the bottom of this page and notify
you that material changes have been made to these Terms. Your continued use of
our Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms
of Service. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of
Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) our Service.

**17.3 Entire Agreement/Severability.** These terms, together with any
amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with R3
Collaboratives in connection with our Service, shall constitute the entire
agreement between you and R3 Collaboratives concerning our Service. Except as
otherwise stated in Section 16.2, if any provision of these Terms is deemed
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision
shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement
these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.

**17.4 Independent Contractor.** No agency, partnership, joint venture, or
employment is created as a result of these Terms and User does not have any
authority of any kind to bind R3 Collaboratives in any respect whatsoever.

**17.5 No Waiver.** No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a
further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and R3
Collaboratives' failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement
shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**17.6 Contact.** Please contact us at support@edthena.com with any questions
regarding these Terms.

It is R3 Collaboratives' policy to (1) block access to or remove content that it
believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied
and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers,
members or users; and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.

### A. Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:

If you believe that content residing on or accessible through the R3
Collaboratives Service infringes a copyright, please notify R3 Collaboratives'

PENALTIES, INCLUDING MONETARY DAMAGES, COURT COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES.

Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying R3 Collaboratives
and its affiliates that your copyrighted material has been infringed. The
preceding requirements are intended to comply with R3 Collaboratives' rights and
obligations under the DMCA, including 17 U.S.C. §512(c), but do not constitute
legal advice. It may be advisable to contact an attorney regarding your rights
and obligations under the DMCA and other applicable laws.

   system; and
4. to terminate such content provider's, member's or user's access to our
   Service.

### C. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:

If the content provider, member or user believes that the content that was
removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content
provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such
content from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent or pursuant to the
law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing
the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

1. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;
2. Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has
   been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was
   removed or disabled;
3. A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief
   that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a
   misidentification of the content; and
4. Content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and,
   if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity
   consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district
   in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if
   the content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the
   United States, for any judicial district in which R3 Collaboratives is
   located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from
   the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, R3 Collaboratives may
send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing
that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10
business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order
against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be
replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after
receipt of the counter-notice, at R3 Collaboratives' discretion.
