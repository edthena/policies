15. MEMBER DISPUTES
-------------------

User is solely responsible for your interactions with other Service users. R3

its officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees)
from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and
nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such

§1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the
creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing
the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement
with the debtor."

16. COPYRIGHT
-------------

All content included on the Site, such as text, graphics, logos, button icons,
images, audio clips, digital downloads, data compilations, and software, is the
property of R3 Collaboratives or its content suppliers and is protected by
United States and international copyright laws. The compilation of all content
on the Site is the exclusive property of R3 Collaboratives and is protected by
U.S. and international copyright laws. All software used on (or provided
through) the Site is the property of R3 Collaboratives or its software suppliers

communicating with R3 Collaboratives electronically. User hereby consents to
receive communications from R3 Collaboratives electronically. R3 Collaboratives
will communicate with User by e-mail or by posting notices on the Site. User
agrees that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that
R3 Collaboratives provides to User electronically satisfy any legal requirements
that such communications be in writing.

18. MISCELLANEOUS
-----------------

The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for
herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. R3
Collaboratives shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations
hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond R3 Collaboratives'
reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or
communications failure or degradation (including "line-noise" interference). If
any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that
provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that
this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by User except
with R3 Collaboratives' prior written consent. R3 Collaboratives may transfer,
assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without
consent. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the state of California, as if made within California between two
residents thereof, and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, (but without limiting either party's
right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief immediately, at any time, in
any court of competent jurisdiction), any disputes arising with respect to this
Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules and
procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. ("JAMS"). The
arbitrator shall be selected by joint agreement of the parties. In the event the
parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating
party providing the other party with written notice that it plans to seek
arbitration, the parties shall each select an arbitrator affiliated with JAMS,
which arbitrators shall jointly select a third such arbitrator to resolve the
dispute. The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on
the parties and enforceable in any court. The arbitration proceeding shall take
place in San Francisco, California, using the English language. Both parties
agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual
understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and
oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed
by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership,
joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and User
does not have any authority of any kind to bind R3 Collaboratives in any respect
whatsoever.

19. DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT NOTICE
-------------------------------------------

R3 Collaboratives has adopted the following general policy toward copyright
infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(<http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf>). The address of R3
Collaboratives' Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement
("Designated Agent") is listed at the end of this policy.

It is R3 Collaboratives' policy to (1) block access to or remove content that it
believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied
and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers,
members or users; and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.

### A. Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:

If User believes that content residing on or accessible through the R3
Collaboratives Service infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright
infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed
below:

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of
the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;

2. Identification of works or materials being infringed;

3. Identification of the content that is claimed to be infringing including
information regarding the location of the content that the copyright owner seeks
to have removed, with sufficient detail so that R3 Collaboratives is capable of
finding and verifying its existence;

4. Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number
and, if available, e-mail address;

5. A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the content is not
authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf
of the copyright owner.

<h3>B. Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the
Designated Agent:</h3>

It is R3 Collaboratives' policy:

1. to remove or disable access to the infringing content;

2. to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or
disabled access to the content;

3. that repeat offenders will have the infringing content removed from the
system; and

4. to terminate such content provider's, member's or user's access to the
service.

### C. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:

If the content provider, member or user believes that the content that was
removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content
provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such
content from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent or pursuant to the
law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing
the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

1. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;

2. Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has
been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was
removed or disabled;

3. A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief
that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a
misidentification of the content; and

4. Content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and,
if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents
to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the
content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if the content
provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for
any judicial district in which R3 Collaboratives is located, and that such
person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided
notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, R3 Collaboratives may
send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing
that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10
business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order
against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be
replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after
receipt of the counter-notice, at R3 Collaboratives' discretion.
