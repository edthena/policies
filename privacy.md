## PRIVACY POLICY

Edthena is provided by R3 Collaboratives, Inc. (“R3 Collaboratives”),
located at 95 Third Street Fl 2, San Francisco, CA 94103. This Privacy Policy
applies the Edthena website and mobile application(s) as well as any other
websites or applications we own or operate (collectively, our “Service”),
and explains our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure,
and protection of personal information as well as your choices regarding
the collection and use of information. Capitalized terms that are not
defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms of
Use](terms.md). Your use of the Edthena Service constitutes your agreement to
the Edthena Terms of Use and to this Privacy Policy.

### 1. How We Collect Personal Information

Personal information is information that can personally identify a specific
individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, email address, and other
information linked to that personal identifier. We collect personal information
in a number of ways from our website visitors and Users of our Service.

__A. Information you provide.__ We ask for certain information when a teacher,
student-teacher, school administrator or other individual (our “Users” or
“User”) registers for a Edthena account or corresponds with us online,
which could include your first and last name, email address, profile picture,
user name and password, billing and payment information, and/or any additional
personal information you voluntarily provide in your Edthena profile, which
could include, but is not limited to, your school name and location, your
coursework or degree information, what grade level and subject matter you
teach, your position within the school, and similar information. We collect
personal information if you send us a message or respond to emails and surveys.
We may also collect information about your friends and colleagues that you
invite to join the Service or to view your content on the Service. We use this
contact information to send the invitations and reminder emails, and other
communications.

__B. Information collected through the use of the Service.__ Once the User has
created an account, we collect content and information provided by the Users
on the Service. For example, Users could provide information about coursework,
assignments, class rosters, photos, images, video, feedback, comments and other
communications. All content provided by the Users to or through the Service is
“User Submissions.” As provided in our [Terms of Use](terms.md), you are
responsible for the User Submissions you post to the Service.

__C. Information We Collect From Third Party Services and Social Media Sites.__
We may collect information about you from third party services that you
connect to our Service. For example, if you login through Google or other
single-sign-on services, share Edthena content on social media sites, or if
you access other third party services, such as DropBox, Google Drive, YouTube,
and other websites (“Third Party Services”), through the Edthena Service
in order to share certain content selected and approved by you with those
services, and/or to import content into the Edthena Service, these third
parties may provide us information about you. We may also receive information
about you if you interact with our site through various social media, for
example, by liking us on Facebook or following us on Twitter. The data we
receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network or
other third party site. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust
your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or
connecting them to the Service.

__D. Student Data.__ To the extent that our Service is used by a College,
University, local education agency, teacher, or other educational institution
(“Educational Institution”) and (a) its students as part of school
curriculum (e.g., a teacher training program in a University, or (b) by
teachers (e.g. as part of a teachers improvement program), the personal
information we collect through the Service may include personal information
from “educational records” as defined by the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g) (“Student Data”). We
consider Student Data to be highly confidential, and we utilize this data only
to provide our Service and as permitted in this Privacy Policy and [Terms of
Use](terms.md).

__E. Information Relating to Non-Users, including K12 Students.__ As part of
the Service, our Users, including teachers and teachers-in-training (“Student
Teachers”), may upload User Submissions that contains videos, images or
personal information of K12 students, teachers, or other non-users of the
Service. As a User, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the
appropriate rights and consents to share any such content you upload or share
with the Edthena Service, including by obtaining any consents necessary from
parents, teachers, school administrators and/or school districts, and to ensure
you comply with all laws that may apply to the personal information of others
that you provide in User Submissions. Although R3 Collaboratives strives to
apply high data privacy standards to all of the information in its possession,
and does not use or share User Submissions other than as described in this
Privacy Policy, any personal information related to non-users that may be
provided in User Submissions is not strictly subject to this Privacy Policy.
Please see our [Terms of Use](terms.md) to learn more about User Submissions.

__F. Information Collected Through Technology.__ We automatically collect
certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our
Service. This information is typically collected through cookies, log files,
web beacons, and similar tracking technology (collectively, “cookies”).

Service (e.g., mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile
device operating system brand and model, and, depending on your mobile device
settings, your geographical location data. We may also collect analytics data,

for the Service. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of
our visitors, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your

mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through
settings.

__Please note that although we may permit third party advertising partners to
collect information on our Edthena website for the purpose of sending targeted
advertisements, we do not allow third party advertising networks to collect
information about students or teachers who are logged into our Service for the
purpose of sending targeted advertisements.__

### 2. How We Use and Share Your Personal Information

The Edthena Service facilitates the sharing of User Submissions and
communications between Users. We share data within the Service as needed to
perform the Service and we share data at our User’s request and direction.
For example, User Submissions may be shared between Users to facilitate
feedback and training to improve learning outcomes. Sharing within the Service
will depend on the settings and functionality selected by the User. We only
share personal information with third parties in limited circumstances,
described below. __We will never share, use or sell Student Data or User
Submissions with third parties for marketing purposes.__

The Edthena Service uses and shares your personal information in the following
ways:

A. With your consent. We share information with your consent and at your
direction. The Service is a communication tool that permits and encourages
data sharing and communication between Users. A User may control which other
Users may access her User Submissions, and may invite and authorize non-users
to access her User Submissions. By accessing and using the Service through a
license provided by an educational institution, employer, or other third party
institution, the User must also consent to have User Submissions and personal
information shared with the institution that provides for the license. In all
other circumstances, a User may authorize a specific individual (either another
User or a non-user), or a class of individuals through Settings, to access User
Submissions under her control.

B. With our trusted vendors and third party service providers. We may share
personal information with certain trusted vendors, third party service
providers and individuals to perform tasks on our behalf, but strictly for
the purpose of carrying out their work for us, which may include business
development, software design, hosting, payments, accounting, and other similar
services. Personal information will be shared with these third parties as
reasonably needed to perform their services to us, and under reasonable
confidentiality terms. Vendors and service providers who have access to 
Student Data, if any, shall be subject to privacy and confidentiality provisions
no less protective than those provided herein.

C. We may share information with other companies owned by or under common
ownership with R3 Collaboratives. These companies will use your personal
information in the same way as we can under this Privacy Policy.

D. Aggregate Data. We will share information in an aggregated and/or anonymous
form that does not reasonably identify you directly as an individual. For
example, we may share aggregate data with other Users to display statistical
data related to the use of the Service. Or, we can use and share aggregate data
to provide feedback to our Users or to measure certain metrics over time. We
may also use aggregate or anonymized data to study and improve our Service,
user functionality, and product offerings.

E. We may disclose your personal information if we have a good faith belief
that the disclosure is necessary to (i) comply with the law or legal process;
(ii) to comply with or the reasonable request of law enforcement; (iii) to
enforce or apply our Terms of Use or other agreements or to protect the
security or integrity of our Service; and/or (iv) to exercise or protect the
rights, property, or safety of R3 Collaboratives, our employees, our Users, or
others.

F. If R3 Collaboratives or some or all of its assets were acquired or otherwise 
transferred to a third party in the course of a company transaction, such as 
a merger, sale of company assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of 
control, bankruptcy or other corporate event, the personal information of our Users 
may be transferred to or acquired by a third party. If the transaction involves the 
transfer of Student Data or User Submissions to a third party, we will require the 
third party to agree to be subject to the same commitments set forth in this Privacy 
Policy  or we will provide you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the 
transfer of Student Data and User Submissions by terminating your account 
before the transfer occurs.

### 3. Communications

As part of our Service, we may use your information to communicate with you
about your account or transactions with us, or send you information about
Service updates, newsletters, or promotional materials. You acknowledge
that by using the Service, R3 Collaboratives and our trusted third party
business partners working on our behalf may send you email or engage in other
communications with you. You can unsubscribe from these emails by clicking on
the “unsubscribe” button within the body of the email. Please note that
you are not permitted to unsubscribe or opt-out of non-promotional messages
regarding your account, such as account verification, changes or updates
to features of the Service, or technical or security notices. We may also
communicate with you via in-app notifications or in-Service messaging. You may
be able to control these communications through your Settings.

When you provide an email address to invite a friend or colleague to join the
Service or to view your content on the Service, we will use this information
to send the invitation, and we may send 1-2 reminder emails if we have not
received a response. From time to time, we may also send these individuals
email communications letting them know more about R3 Collaboratives and the
Edthena Service. The recipients may unsubscribe from these emails by clicking
on the “unsubscribe” button within the body of the email at any time.

### 4. Links to Other Websites

The Edthena Service and our email communications may contain links to other
websites or services. These other websites and services are not under R3
Collaboratives’ control, and such links do not constitute an endorsement by
R3 Collaboratives of those other websites. The privacy and security practices
of websites linked to or from the Service are not covered by this Privacy
Policy, and R3 Collaboratives is not responsible for the privacy or security
practices or the content of such websites. Moreover, R3 Collaboratives is not
responsible for any third party links which may be provided in User Submissions
by our Users. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of any
third party website or service before providing them with personal information.

### 5. Our Security and Data Storage Practices
R3 Collaboratives cares about the security of your information and uses commercially
reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the
integrity and security of all information we collect. These safeguards can include, 
but are not limited to, password protection, need-based access, firewall and encryption, 
physical security controls for our office and company locations, employee training, 
and other such mechanisms. Our security team periodically reviews our information 
storage and security practices and updates our policies and practices as needed to 
address changing technologies and known threats. In the event that any 
information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security,
we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate,
notify those Users whose information may have been compromised and take other steps,
in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed
in the United States or any other country in which R3 Collaboratives or
its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. If
you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing
data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that
we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country
and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your
jurisdiction. By using this Service, you consent to such transfer, and you
agree that R3 Collaboratives may process your personal information in the
United States or any other jurisdiction, as described in this Privacy Policy.

### 6. Control, Access and Deletion of Personal Information

You may access, update or correct your personal information at any time by
logging into your account.

User accounts and User Submissions are maintained on the Service unless and
until R3 Collaboratives receives a deletion request from the User. In the
future, R3 Collaboratives may delete dormant accounts and User Submissions,
subject to storage constraints.

To delete an account, please contact us at <support@edthena.com>. R3
Collaboratives will promptly delete or de-identify the account, including the
User Submissions within the account, within thirty (30) days of such request
or instruction, though we may retain and use certain information if necessary
to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
agreements, and all information stored in our backup data repository will be
deleted pursuant to our standard deletion policy. We may not be able to delete
feedback or comments you provide to another User or another User’s User
Submission on the Service. Please note that Users accessing the Service under
an institution’s enterprise license may not be able to delete an account
without the institution’s approval. Please contact your university, employer,
or other institution through which you obtained the license to discuss account
deletion.

We may maintain aggregate or de-identified data in a form that does not
reasonably identify a particular individual, for our internal use or analytic
purposes.

If you are a parent, teacher, or school administrator and would like to
request access information relating to a student or minor who may appear in
User Submissions that has been posted on the Service, please contact us at
<privacy@edthena.com> and we will do our best to assist you. User Submissions
are owned and controlled by our Users, who are responsible for obtaining all
appropriate consents necessary to collect and share the User Submissions with
the Edthena Service.

### 7. Compliance with COPPA and FERPA

R3 Collaboratives complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
Act (“COPPA”). R3 Collaboratives does not knowingly collect personal
information through the Edthena Service from a child under 13, unless a User
has affirmed that she has obtained appropriate consent from the child’s
school or teacher to post such information to the Service. Please contact us at
<privacy@edthena.com> if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal
information from a child under 13 without proper consents so that we may delete
such information as soon as possible.

R3 Collaboratives complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA). The personal information we collect from certain of our Users, for
example, those Users who utilize the Edthena Service as part of a teacher
training program at a college or university, may be subject to provisions of
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and applicable state
laws, and by other state, federal and international laws relating to the
collection and use of student data. We consider the information of student
records to be highly confidential, and we utilize this data only to provide our
Service and as permitted in this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. We do not engage 
in targeted advertising based on information that we collect from students 
through the Service and we do not use collected information to amass student 
profiles except in furtherance of an educational purpose or as requested by the user. 

Edthena Users are solely responsible for assuring compliance with FERPA, COPPA
and other privacy laws which may be applicable to the personal information of
non-users, including, potentially, K12 students, that may be contained in the
User Submissions the User provides to the Edthena Service.

### 8. Our Privacy Policy Will Change Over Time

R3 Collaboratives may amend this Privacy Statement from time to time. If we
make any changes to this Policy, we will change the "effective date" below and
will post the updated Policy on this page. We will use our best efforts to
provide at least 30 days-notice of a Privacy Policy change that may involve
collecting, using, storing, or sharing personal data in a materially different
way than was disclosed in our previous Privacy Policy, so that you have
sufficient time to evaluate the change in practice. If you do not choose to
accept the changes, you may opt-out by deleting your account before the changes
take effect. Continuing to use our Services after the effective date of the
revised Privacy Policy means that you consent to the changes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not make any material changes to this 
Privacy Policy that relate to the collection or use of Student Data without first 
giving notice to the School and providing a choice before Student Data is used in 
a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.

privacy policy or would like to contact us for any reason, you may reach us at
